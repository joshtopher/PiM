# PiM
This is a re-visit of one of my previous projects 'pybot'. Initially, the project was a Discord bot that helped manage discord servers, however this bot will attempt to use sentiment analysis to tag malicious messages and report them to the server owner.

To add PiM to your discord server, use this URL. PiM needs administrator privileges for full functionality.

# Goals
1) To assess the difference in python programming, practices, readability, and knowledge with my current self and myself and myself before taking any higher level computer science classes('pybot').
2) To create a practical tool that I am able to use for myself and share with others.
3) To become more familiar with sentiment analysis tools used in a course I am currently taking: 'Text Mining for AI' at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.
